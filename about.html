        <p>I’m a Geography Ph.D. student at the <a href="https://geography.wisc.edu/">University of Wisconsin-Madison</a>, where I research property law and inheritance practice in the rural Upper Midwest and Northern Great Plains. Currently, I’m an editor at <em><a href="http://edgeeffects.net/">Edge Effects</a></em>, a digital magazine of environmental humanities and the primary publication of the <a href="https://nelson.wisc.edu/che/">UW-Madison Center for Culture, History, and Environment</a>. As part of my Ph.D. program, I teach courses in historical geography and environmental history and enjoy my work with undergraduate students. Finally, I’m a writer and lead a writer’s group for graduate students in the environmental humanities that supports both creative and scholarly work. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I aspire to a career in higher education where I can contribute to the future of the public and environmental humanities within the university. Most recently, I worked as Program Director at the University of Virginia <a href="https://culturallandscapes.arch.virginia.edu/">Center for Cultural Landscapes</a>, where I took a lead role in the successful development of a Mellon Foundation proposal to fund an interdisciplinary initiative in Landscape Studies. I decided to return to graduate school as a doctoral student to build my own research agenda within the field of Landscape Studies and work directly with undergraduate students as a teacher.
        <br>
        <br>
        Outside of school and work, I like to get outdoors, compete in triathlons, and travel. I’m a Virginia transplant in the Midwest and have never met a cheese I didn’t like.</p>
